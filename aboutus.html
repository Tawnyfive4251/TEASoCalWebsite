											<h3>What are we?</h3>
											<p>In 2011 the SouthCoast Chapter of TiE (The Indus Entrepreneur) first supported and sponsored TYE (TiE Young Entrepreneurs). This program has been described as a “mini-MBA meets Shark Tank” style competition for high school students: they form teams/companies, create a lean business canvas, prototype or develop their products, and pitch their ideas to a panel of judges at the program’s completion.

										<h3>For Entrepreneurs, By Entrepreneurs.</h3>
										<p>
												The Entrepreneur Academy was founded over 10 years ago to serve and nurture the Entrepreneus of Tomorrow. As part of San Diego's local TiE chapter, our program has access to the cream of the crop for its leaders. The current head, Sandeep Varma, is the founder of his own financial advisory firm, Advanced Trustee Strategies, which operates all across California offering creative solutions for financial management and charitable giving.


										</p>
										<p>The beauty of the The Entrepreneur Academy program, however, is in its approach to teaching. Rather than the traditional teacher to student method, The Entrepreneur Academy invites business and industry professionals nation wide to teach masterclasses in their specialties. For example, Steve Morley, one of the first 10 members of Qualcomm, gave a lecture on pitching technology startups. Generalized coaching is provided as well, in 15-minute instructional videos and 5-minute quizzes. </p>
										<h3>Quality Mentorship.</h3>
										<p>In addition to masterclass sessions, our network of professionals are matched to teams for 1:1 mentorship. After the first mock competition, teams determine which areas their strengths and weaknesses lie in. For example, the 2020 winning team, Fynking Analytics, determined their questions mainly lay in the legal and operations side of their industry and identified their key advantage as superior modeling. The TEA program matched them to Anders Norrman from the San Diego Pension Fund to discuss strategy and legal, and Professor David Fogel from UCSD. Not only was The Entrepreneur Academy able to mentor the team's entrepreneurial journey, but they were able to foster tech development as well. </p>
										<h4>Some of our standout mentors include:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>University Professors</li>
											<li>High-ranking engineers</li>
											<li>Serial Founders</li>
											<li>Consultants</li>
											<li>New York Times- Bestselling Authors</li>
										</ul>
